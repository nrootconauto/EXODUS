# EXODUS: Executable Divine Operating System in Userspace

![EXODUS](img/Exodus.png)

EXODUS is a port of the TempleOS kernel to user space for x86_64 Linux, Windows
and FreeBSD, so that you can run TempleOS without a virtual machine.  It
contains a mostly full-featured GUI from stock TempleOS, and a CLI mode
which has found uses for running the networked servers automatically and building
EXODUS' kernel itself.

# Building EXODUS

## Linux/FreeBSD

Install the packages for CMake and the development headers for SDL2.
Navigate to the directory and run these commands:

```sh
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j$(nproc);
cd ..
```

You\'ll see the `exodus` binary. NOTE: `WARN`s during the build process aren\'t
a sign of failure.

### My build hangs!

Provide a gdb/lldb backtrace after running it on gdb and building it with the CMake flag `BUILD_HCRT=0` (command line argument is `-DBUILD_HCRT=0` after the cmake invocation part of the line above). If it throws a backtrace immediately, post the backtrace with `bt`. If it just hangs in gdb without any immediate diagnostics, press CTRL+C, and open an issue with the result of `p (char *)WhichFun($pc)`.

## Windows

Windows users tend to be less technically sophisticated,
so here is a more detailed instruction:

1. Install [msys2](https://msys2.org)
2. Run "MSYS2 MINGW64" (NOTE: ***MUST*** BE MINGW64, NO SUPPORT FOR OTHER ENVIRONMENTS)
3. Run `pacman -Sy git mingw-w64-x86_64-{gcc,SDL2,cmake}`
4. Clone this repository
5. Run the following after navigating to the directory(Ignore any `WARN`s):
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
ninja
cd ..
```
5. You will see the `exodus` binary in the directory

# Running EXODUS

Run EXODUS with `./exodus`.

Consult `./exodus -h` for more command-line options such as CLI mode.

# Features
- Host filesystem integration (T:/ is the root drive, and Z:/ is where EXODUS was launched)
- Documentation in T:/Server (run `#include "run";` after `Cd("Server");`, on localhost:8080)
- Mostly orthodox TempleOS GUI
- CLI mode
- Community software in T:/Community, such as Satania-buddy and games like BlazeItFgt2
- Networking (Take a look at T:/Community/{gihon,HolyIRC} and T:/Server's code)

There have been some disputes on whether TempleOS can have networking or not.
To borrow the man's words, God did not ban networking.
Terry didn't implement networking in stock TempleOS because of
the line number restriction.

["God did not ban networking"](https://old.reddit.com/r/TempleOS_Official/comments/2pzdy6/can_there_be_networking/cn1kshe/) [(archived)](https://archive.is/0epu3)

Terry has also documented that the ideal TempleOS PC needs networking through a simple
serial interface.

# Changes from stock TempleOS
- CTRL+ALT+P to toggle the palette to/from dark mode
- The Windows key functionality has been replaced with the Alt key
- Context switching is slower than a VM or native hardware because it runs in Ring 3, but it does not degrade general performance
- Ring-0 opcodes (HLT, etc) and routines (InU8, etc) are not available (you can assemble the opcodes but they'll raise a fault)
- Fs and Gs are pointers to CTask/CCPU instead of the whole structures at gs:0xe8 and gs:0xf0 respectively, \[0xE8,0x100) is a range not used by anything except the NTFS driver and WinSrv on Windows, both of which do not touch user application threads. GS is a free register on Linux/FreeBSD.

# Very quick HolyC reference
```C
/* CTRL+SHIFT+F<num shown in autocomplete window>
 * after typing in a function name will show its src */
DirMk("folder");
Dir;
Dir("fold*");//supports wildcards
Cd("folder");
Man("Ed");
Ed("file.HC.Z");
Unzip("file.HC.Z");
Zip("file.HC");
Find("str",,"-i");//"-i" is for case-sensitivity (grep -rn . -e str)
FF("file.*");//find .|grep file
RedSeaISO("Something.ISO.C","Community");//archive folder into an ISO
MountFile("Something.ISO.C");//defaults to M
Cd("M:/");
*0=0;//Raise the debugger
Help;//Prints debugging help in debugger, pops up help index when normal
Shutdown;
```
